# Overview

This is a simple hello world project programmed in python.

The main purpose of this project is to:
1. Test and practice setting up a python development enviroment on a windows computer.
2. Understand how and why to use a .gitignore file.

I hope this will prepare me for the Rust, Maching Learning, and Cloud Database projects I have planned for the future.
